# Medical-Speciality-Prediction
Predicting the medical speciality based on the medical transcription using supervised algorithms, Latent Semantic Analysis {LSA) , LSTM model.  
<ul>
  <li>Dataset: obtained from kaggle. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions">https://www.kaggle.com/tboyle10/medicaltranscriptions</a>  
    <li> Preprocessing: Transcriptions in Medical records are bit difficult to preprocess because we have to care a lot about the transcripts. Nonetheless, normal preproceesong is performed.</li>  
  <li>Modeling: There is an issue of class imbalance in this dataset. To deal with it SMOTE oversampling algorithms has been used. Beside machine learning algorithms used here i also used Latent Semantic Analysis and LSTM too and the results were almost comparable so i didnot include them in this repo.</li>
